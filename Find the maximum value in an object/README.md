# The maximal salary

There is a salaries object:

``` javascript
let salaries = {
  "John": 100,
  "Pete": 300,
  "Mary": 250
};
```
If salaries is empty, it should return null.
If there are multiple top-paid persons, return any of them.

P.S. Use Object.entries and destructuring to iterate over key/value pairs.
