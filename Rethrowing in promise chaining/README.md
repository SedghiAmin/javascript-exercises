#Rethrowing

.catch at the end of the chain is similar to try..catch. We may have as many .then handlers as we want, and then use a single .catch at the end to handle errors in all of them.

In a regular try..catch we can analyze the error and maybe rethrow it if it canâ€™t be handled. The same thing is possible for promises.

If we throw inside .catch, then the control goes to the next closest error handler. And if we handle the error and finish normally, then it continues to the next closest successful .then handler.
